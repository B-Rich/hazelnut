<h2>
Pending problems</h2>

<h4>
on a write, ARM reports a read pagefault first if no mapping was present
(u)</h4>

<blockquote>I fear, we have to do this evil code analysis thing on a <i>translation
abort</i> to figure out whether it was a read or a write access.
<br>Write accesses on read-only mapped pages are fine - these cause a <i>permission
abort</i>.</blockquote>

<h4>
L4/Linux enter_kdebugs "non linux task" (u)</h4>

<blockquote>The linux kernel received an IPC with no error code, but the
sender's thread_id was not valid.
<br>Non-solution: Some exits in sys_ipc returning an error code didn't
keep the dest_id as specified.
<p>Note: Not seen anymore since 2000-04-10.</blockquote>

<h4>
IPC via sysenter/sysexit works (u)</h4>

<blockquote>We use a modified version of Jochen's proposal for the int
0x30 replacement
<br>The kernel esp is restored from the tss.esp0 location directly after
entering the kernel. This saves the expensive (serializing) wrmsr to update
the MSR_0x175.</blockquote>

<h4>
First steps towards the sysenter/sysexit IPC mechanism</h4>

<blockquote><b>sysenter</b>: MSR_0x174 -> cs; MSR_0x174 + 8 -> ss; MSR_0x175
-> esp; MSR_0x176 -> eip
<br>The esp register is overwritten on sysenter, no return information
is saved implicitly.
<br><b>sysexit</b>: MSR_0x174 + 16 -> cs; MSR_0x174 + 16 + 8 -> ss; ecx
-> esp; edx -> eip
<br>The registers ecx and edx must contain esp and eip and thus are not
free for use.
<p>The kernel esp (MSR_0x175) must be updated on every thread switch.
<br>Jochen proposes to store the return address on the user's stack and
to keep the user's esp in ecx.</blockquote>

<h4>
An IPC with timeout NEVER returns with error code 0x20 (timeout) (u)</h4>

<blockquote>Problem: This happened due to not dequeueing threads from the
wakeup queue. We relied on the scheduler to dequeue threads from the wakeup
queue. But this holds only, if the timeout becomes active. In case of an
IPC happening before the timeout expiry, the thread remained in the wakeup
queue.
<br>Scenario: L4/Linux' bottom half thread does IPCs with timeout and with
timeout NEVER. If an IPC with a timeout succeeded before the timeout became
active, the thread remained in the wakeup queue. Later on, when the thread
did an IPC with timeout NEVER, the scheduler found the thread in the wakeup
queue with an expired timeout and activated the thread. The thread then
concluded, that it woke up due to a timeout and returned with an error
code indicating a receive timeout (0x20).
<br>Solution: put calls to thread_dequeue_wakeup wherever they're required</blockquote>

<h4>
L4/Linux enter_kdebugs "wrong access" after some l4_thread_ex_regs from
the signal thread (u)</h4>

<blockquote>Scenario: The signal thread changes the thread's IP to an endless
loop in the emulib. Then it installes a faked exception 20 and kicks the
thread to the exception handler ... which then returns to the thread.
<br>Problem: Sometimes the worker thread is in a pagefault IPC. L4/KA does
an unwind_ipc by kicking the thread back to user land, but with trashed
registers, but the worker thread doesn't know that its registers were trashed.
<br>Solution: unwind_ipc must not unwind the IPC by placing the thread
in userland. It must abort only the IPC operation (i.e., return to the
place where do_pagefault_ipc was called), which means that we have to save
more state information. :-(
<p>Would it be enough to save the last_ipc_ksp to the TCB and restore that
on an aborted IPC (if it was valid)?
<br>Late night note: Yes it is. Currently, a return-to-able stack frame
is created in do_pagefault_ipc and its location is stored in the TCB (unwind_ipc_sp).</blockquote>

<h4>
l4_thread_schedule doesn't work in RMGR</h4>

<blockquote>sbd. cut the RMGR local c-binding for l4_thread_schedule short
<br>Having more than <b>one</b> set of syscall bindings is not really healthy!!!</blockquote>

L4/Linux spuriously enter_kdebugs "bh error"</h4>

<blockquote>Still looking for the reason of wait(..., IPC_NEVER) returning
with timeout</blockquote>

<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">2000-04-10</h2>

<h4>
L4/Linux sometimes enter_kdebugs "wrong stack" when processes are killed</h4>

<blockquote>Scenario: An L4/Linux task is hit by a signal -> its signal
thread receives a message from the L4/Linux kernel. Then it does an lthread_ex_regs
on its worker thread (which might be in a pagefault (effectively in an
IPC which has to be aborted)).
<br>In unwind_ipc we called thread_dequeue_send(tcb,tcb) with exchanged
arguments. This led to a kernel pagefault by dereferencing a NULL pointer
(Maybe, we should add a check for that?), which was turned into an IPC
to the corresponding pager -> the L4/Linux kernel. To the L4/Linux kernel
this IPC looked like a syscall, but the signal thread must not do Linux
syscalls. Finally, the thread_id of the signal thread didn't match the
thread_id of the worker thread (stored in L4/Linux' TSS structure) -> L4/Linux
complains about the signal thread using the wrong stack (although there
is not even a proper stack for that thread anyway :-)</blockquote>

<h4>
total silence after thread switch</h4>

<blockquote>switching from one thread to another can happen in two ways:
<p>- switch inside the same address space
<br>- switch to a different address space
<p>later is the more interesting and complicated case.
<br>Following situation:
<p>Thread A, address space 1 switches to Thread B, address space 2
<p>assume that the tcb of thread A is not mapped in address space 2. Thus,
a
<br>switch to AS2 *BEFORE* the stack is switched to thread B will cause
a
<br>pagefault on the stack of thread A (since it is not mapped in AS 2).
But the
<br>pagefault handler usually operates on the stack. Therefore, the system
hangs
<br>in an infinite pagefault loop.
<p>Solution:
<br>To switch from one address space to another, stacks must be switched
BEFORE
<br>the address space is switched. If a pagefault is raised in the destination
<br>AS on the source tcb, we already have a valid stack and can handle
the
<br>fault.

<h4>
crazy unpredictable behavior when changing small sections in the code (x86)</h4>

<blockquote>probably, GRUB used the memory where the x86-kernel was loaded
for its own purpose, after the image was loaded
<br>short term solution: relocate .init section
<br>long term solution: sign your code and check signature before execution</blockquote>

<tt>.text</tt>

somewhere but not even near the <tt>.text</tt> section. (u)</blockquote>

<h4>
Make compatibility</h4>

older version seemed unable to include the Makeconf file, probably caused
by a parsing error. Things broke when I started using $(error ... ), I
guess. (u)</blockquote>

<h4>
When cpp goes crazy</h4>

<blockquote>like
<br><b><tt>#define blah(x) \</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>{ \</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>&nbsp; foo; \</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>} \</tt></b>
<br>being preprocessed as
<br><b><tt>{</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>&nbsp; foo;</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>}</tt></b>
<br>you might suffer from DOSified files. Emacs not showing <b><tt>^M</tt></b>
doesn't tell you anything.
<br>Using cvs under NT with a working directory on a samba share and the
repository accessed via rsh does unix2dos and dos2unix translations when
checking in/out. Files in working directory contain <b><tt>^M</tt></b>.

VMWare - accessing nonexistent phys mem -> pgfault</h4>

<h4>
VMWare uses parts of the virtual mem</h4>

<blockquote>VMWare does not allow full usage of memory beyond 0xFFFF0000.
VMWare stops with errors like "muli not emulated". It seems that memory
used above that point cannot hold stuff like gdt and idt. (v)</blockquote>
